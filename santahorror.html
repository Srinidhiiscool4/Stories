<p>At the time of this story, I was young enough to be excited to see Santa Claus and still wanted my picture on his lap, but at the same time, I was old enough to know he wasn't real. My whole family was at Grandma's in Chapel Hill on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Our tradition was to go to the mall for all the sales to seek out deals on clothes and gifts. Black Friday is the beginning of the holiday shopping frenzy.
As soon as we entered the main gallery of the mall, I saw Santa sitting in his chair with Christmas trees on both sides and boxes of wrapped presents with big red bows. There were white reindeer with colored lights and a sparkling snowman. Santa sat with rosy cheeks and a big smile, chuckling with children on his knee. He was the perfect Santa with a twinkle in his eye. Even if it was a fake white beard that I could easily see.</p>

<h2>Meeting Santa</h2>

<p>I was so excited I screamed, "Santa, Mom, look, it's Santa. Can we get my picture?"
She looked at the ten-mile-long line and said, "Maybe later, dear if that line isn't so long. Let's shop now."We shopped all morning, had lunch at California Pizza Kitchen, a favorite place, and continued trying on clothes in the afternoon. I was so tired we rested at the cookie company Crumbl, where I had a Snickerdoodle Cupcake. So delicious!As we re-entered the mall, I saw Santa again. This time, there was no line at all. I begged Mom, "Please let me tell Santa what I want for Christmas."</p>

<p>We walked over, and Mom put five dollars into the tip box held by a plastic elf. I ran up to Santa, and he grabbed me roughly under my arms and yanked me off my feet and onto his lap. He was squeezing me very uncomfortably and saying, "Cute little girl, touch Santa, let's smile." I looked up into his eyes. It wasn't the kindly red-cheeked Santa I had seen in the morning. This Santa had bloodshot eyes and stained, dirty brown cheeks under the fake Santa beard. His teeth were rotted, and his breath stunk like an outhouse. I tried to wiggle free, but he was holding me so tightly against his body. I looked at my mom, who was ready to take my picture with her iPhone. She saw my terror. She screamed, "Let my daughter go, you creep!"
She grabbed my arm and pulled me from his grip. He fell to the floor in a drunken pool of saliva, his beard hanging around his neck. He staggered off, disappearing into the mall. The real Santa was found unconscienced and stripped of his costume, having been mugged on his break. The fake Santa was never found. This is my chilling nightmare and the reason I'm afraid of Santa.</p>
